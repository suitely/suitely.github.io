    <h4>How It Works</h4>

    <p>Trained on the Wisdom of Generations. Tuned for the Speed of Now.</p>

    <p>Suitely is built on a proprietary large language model stack, engineered for executive cognition. At its core, it blends expert-level decision reasoning with deep domain context—trained on a knowledge base no single executive could master alone:<p>

    <h4>Business School Textbooks</h4>

    <p>The foundational frameworks of strategy, finance, operations, and leadership—from MBA staples to executive education blueprints.</p>

    <h4>Thousands of Case Studies</h4>

    <p>Decades of real-world business scenarios spanning industries, geographies, and market cycles. Suitely learns from the outcomes—successes and failures alike.</p>

    <h4>Legal Precedents & Court Documents</h4>

    <p>Incorporates risk-aware reasoning from regulatory actions, board disputes, compliance cases, and governance history.</p>

    <h4>Biographies of Celebrated Leaders</h4>

    <p>Distilled insights from the lives and decisions of iconic executives—Jobs, Bezos, Welch, Nooyi, Musk, and more—providing a nuanced understanding of leadership psychology and legacy strategy.</p>

    <h4>Live Learning Infrastructure</h4>

    <p>Suitely continuously fine-tunes itself on your company’s own internal data—meeting notes, reports, financials, and KPIs—ensuring decisions are always aligned with your specific business context.</p>
